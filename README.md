# Unity Next Blog

Welcome to my blog, a personal space where I share my journey in Unity technology and game development, built with the [Next.js and Tailwind CSS blogging starter template](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog).

## Introduction

This blog is a platform where I explore and share my experiences and learnings in Unity technology and game development. Leveraging the power of Next.js and Contentlayer, it provides a seamless blogging experience with server-side rendered pages, incremental static regeneration, and optimized image handling.

## Acknowledgments

A big thank you to the original creator of the Tailwind Next.js Starter Blog, all contributors, and everyone providing feedback. Your contributions are invaluable.
