### Hi there 👋

import { FamiliarTechStack } from '@/components/FamiliarTechStack'

👋 Hi there, I'm a passionate **Unity Game Developer** 🕹️ who has been crafting games since early 2016. I have a penchant for mid-core RPGs and have created quite a few of them. RPGs are my favorite genre, both to play 🎲 and to develop 🛠️.

🎮 As a gamer, I enjoy fast-paced action games, souls-like, roguelike, and of course, RPGs. My love for gaming fuels my creativity and innovation in game development.

💻 Apart from game development, I also have an interest in web/app development. Currently, I'm diving into the world of Next.js and exploring the fascinating realm of AI 🤖.
