In this article, I describe a developer's skill levels using terms like **Familiarity**, **Knowledge**, **Understanding**, **Deep Understanding**, **Ability**, **Proficiency**, and **Mastery**.

1. **Familiarity**: You've aware of the concept or tool and have used it in actual projects, but you're not yet comfortable with how everything works.
2. **Knowledge**: You understand the basic ideas and some more complex parts, but there's still more to learn, especially about the most advanced features.
3. **Understanding**: You have a solid understanding, including some of the more complex aspects. You're able to solve common issues and can explain how things work to others.
4. **Deep Understanding/Ability**: You have expert-level knowledge and can identify the pros and cons. You're adept at applying this knowledge to a variety of projects.
5. **Proficiency**: You have a high level of skill and can use the concept or tool effectively and efficiently.
6. **Mastery**: You have an outstanding level of expertise, with a deep and comprehensive understanding that enables you to innovate and teach the subject.
