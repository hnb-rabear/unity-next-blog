# What is Unity Heap Explorer and How to Use It for Memory Profiling

Memory management is one of the most important aspects of developing games and applications with Unity. Memory leaks, memory fragmentation, and memory optimization are some of the common challenges that Unity developers face. To address these challenges, Unity provides a built-in Memory Profiler that allows you to inspect the memory usage of your project and find potential issues. However, the Memory Profiler has some limitations and drawbacks, such as:

- It only shows the memory usage of the current scene, not the entire project.
- It does not provide a clear and intuitive user interface to navigate and analyze the memory data.
- It does not support comparing memory snapshots or finding duplicate objects.
- It does not provide any debugging or analysis features for C# objects and delegates.

If you are looking for a more powerful and user-friendly tool to profile, debug, and analyze memory snapshots of your Unity games and applications, you might want to check out Unity Heap Explorer. Unity Heap Explorer is a free and open-source tool developed by Peter Schraut, a veteran game developer and former Unity employee. Unity Heap Explorer is a Memory Profiler, Debugger, and Analyzer for Unity 2019.3 and newer versions. It has the following features and benefits:

- It can capture memory snapshots of the entire project, not just the current scene.
- It provides a simple and elegant user interface to explore and visualize the memory data.
- It supports comparing memory snapshots and finding duplicate objects, both native and managed.
- It provides a comprehensive and detailed view of C# objects, including their references, paths to root, delegates, delegate targets, static fields, memory sections, and empty shell objects.
- It allows you to search for objects by name, type, size, or address, and filter them by various criteria.
- It integrates with Unity's Test Framework and allows you to enable Heap Explorer tests.

Unity Heap Explorer is a great tool for Unity developers who want to improve their memory management skills and optimize their projects. It can help you identify and fix memory leaks, reduce memory fragmentation, and find memory optimization opportunities. It can also help you learn more about how Unity works under the hood and how it handles memory allocation and garbage collection.

## Installation

1. Open your Unity project and navigate to Window > Package Manager.
2. Click the + button at the top left corner and select 'Add package from git URL'.
3. Enter `https://github.com/pschraut/UnityHeapExplorer.git` and click 'Add'.
4. Wait for the package to download and import into your project.

## Using UnityHeapExplorer for Memory Profiling

**Capturing a Memory Snapshot**

- With UnityHeapExplorer installed, you can capture a memory snapshot by opening the tool from "Window > Analysis > Heap Explorer".
- Inside the Heap Explorer window, you'll find the "Capture Snapshot" button. Clicking this will pause your game and take a snapshot of the memory at that moment.

**Analyzing Memory Data**

- The Heap Explorer window provides a variety of tabs and panels, each offering different ways to view and analyze the captured memory data.
- You can explore C# objects, their references, and paths to root, among other things. The tool also allows you to compare memory snapshots, search for specific objects, and filter results based on various criteria.

**Snapshot Comparison**

- To track changes in memory usage over time, you can capture multiple snapshots and use the comparison feature within UnityHeapExplorer.
- This feature helps you identify new objects, released objects, and any changes in memory allocation between two snapshots.

**Integration with Unity's Test Framework**

- UnityHeapExplorer can be integrated with Unity's Test Framework, enabling automated testing related to memory usage.
- To enable Heap Explorer tests, you need to have the Test Framework package installed and set the `HEAPEXPLORER_ENABLE_TESTS` define in your project settings or a `csc.rsp` file.

## Conclusion

UnityHeapExplorer is an essential tool for any Unity developer looking to improve memory management and optimize performance. With its advanced features and user-friendly interface, it provides a level of insight that goes beyond what Unity's built-in Memory Profiler offers. By making UnityHeapExplorer available as an open-source project, Peter Schraut has contributed a valuable resource to the Unity development community. To start using UnityHeapExplorer in your projects, visit the GitHub repository and follow the installation instructions providedÂ¹.
